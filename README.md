# Fake News Detection with NLP

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify news articles as either real or fake based on their textual content.

## Description
- The project utilizes NLP libraries and techniques to preprocess the textual data and extract features.
- The dataset used for training and testing consists of news articles labeled as real or fake.
- Various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization are employed to process the text data.
- The machine learning model used for classification leverages NLP features to make predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: Programming language for implementing NLP techniques and building the model
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): NLP library for text processing tasks
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation
- pandas: Data manipulation library for handling the dataset
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running and documenting the code

## Workflow
1. Data Collection: Obtain a dataset of labeled news articles, where each article is labeled as real or fake.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the text data using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization.
3. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data to represent each article.
4. Model Training: Train a machine learning model, such as a classification algorithm, using the extracted features.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abckhush/fake-news-nlp.git
   cd fake-news-nlp
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fake_news_detection.ipynb

## Conclusion
The NLP-based fake news detection model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying news articles based on their textual content.
